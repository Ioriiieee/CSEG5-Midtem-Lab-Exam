Overview of the algorithms implemented
For algorithm, two pathfinding algorithm are implemented in the system. Greedy Best-First Search and A Search. 


How to use the program:
We use a grid setup to create based on the user input, where each cells represents an open space which is 0 or an obstacle which is 1. User will specify their grid size and provide either it is open space (0) or an obstacle (1)

For example, the user enter an 5x5 grid. The user will now enter 1 by 1 for each rows and column wether if its open space (0) or an obstacle(1)
Example for input:
Enter the number of rows: 5
Enter the number of columns: 5

Enter the grid row by row (use '0' for open cells and '1' for obstacles):
Row 1: 0 1 0 0 0
Row 2: 0 0 0 0 1
Row 3: 0 0 1 0 1
Row 4: 0 1 0 0 1
Row 5: 0 0 1 0 0
